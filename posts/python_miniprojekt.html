                            The main goals of this project are to create a basic understanding of NLP's possibilites and applying it in practice with a small project. This program is a tool that does sentimental text analysis. It uses NLP (natural language processing) to analyze
                            text and decide if the sentiments in the text are negative, neutral, or positive.
                        </p>

                        <p>The program uses TextBlob and newspaper3k</p>

                        <h3>TextBlob:</h3>
                        <p>
                            NLP library built on NLTK and Pattern Capable of other NLP methods, but we use sentiment analysis here. We use ‘sentiment’ which returns a polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and the subjectivity of the text (is it opinionated or factual).
                        </p>

                        <h3>newspaper3k:</h3>
                        <p>
                            newspaper3k is a python library for web scraping articles and news websites. We use this in our code to get text from Wikipedia or other articles. It can also disregard ads, headers, and other things that are irrelevant for us.
                        </p>

                            The results of the analysis will range from 1 to -1 in sentiment. 1 is positive and -1 is negative

                            <strong>Programs analysis result and answer:</strong> Species of bird The Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) is a medium-sized penguin. The Humboldt penguin and the cold water current it swims in both are named after the
                            explorer Alexander von Humboldt. In South America the Humboldt penguin is found only along the Pacific coast, and the range of the Humboldt penguin overlaps that of the Magellanic penguin on the central Chilean coast.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Wikipedia Humboldt Penguin Analysis Explanation -->
                        <p>
                            It senses the summarization of the text as negative. Probably because of this part:<br /> “In South America the Humboldt penguin is found only along the Pacific coast, and the range of the Humboldt penguin overlaps that of
                            the Magellanic penguin on the central Chilean coast”<br /> The word ‘only’ might be seen as a negative word by the program, and the number still being close to 0 should be the result of the Wikipedia article being mostly neutral.

                            <strong>Programs analysis result and answer:</strong> A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo
                            (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita.
                            <br /> Some pizza dough contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.<br /> is similar to an Italian pizza, with a slightly thicker crust and a topping of cooked onions, anchovies, and olives.<br
                            /> Pizza sticks are baked with pizza dough and pizza ingredients.<br /> Bread dough may also be used in their preparation, and some versions are fried.

                        <!-- Pizza Analysis Explanation -->
                        <p>
                            This senses the text to be positive instead, probably because the usage of the word “popular”. The result is still somewhat close to 0 but positive now.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Conclusion -->
                        <h3>What can we get out of this?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We fed the program two Wikipedia articles that should be neutral. But individual words that have slightly negative or positive connotations will in the end still affect the result. Even if they aren’t used in any specific context.<br
                            /> Sentiment analysis algorithms like the ones I’m using in this program might not grasp how the words are used. It uses pre-trained models and lists of negative and positive words.<br /> So in the end we still have to check
                            the content in this program to see if the program has understood the context fully or it might have made a decision based on something irrelevant.<br /> This will be something we will also have to take into consideration for
                            our own project in machine learning when we feed/teach it something.
